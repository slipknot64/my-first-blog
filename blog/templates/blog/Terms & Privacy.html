43. 7.3 79. Miscellaneous. Users must have a payment method on file when selling or buying on Irezumi, and Users must pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. (This includes charging other payment methods on file with us, as well as retaining collection agencies and legal counsel). In addition, Users will be subject to late fees. Also see 8.2 and 8.3 below for fines, deposits, and reimbursement obligations related to violations of this User Agreement.
44. Disputes between Users
45. 8.1 82. Irezumi as Arbitrator. In the event that any User has a dispute with any other User with regard to a transaction on the Site, such User agrees to submit the dispute to Irezumi as the arbitrator for final and binding judgment. In order to allow Irezumi to fairly and reasonably conduct investigations, Users agree to refrain from seeking third party arbitration while an order is still open or pending. Users who seek third party intervention (with the exception of Government Investigative Authorities) will be seen as interfering with the investigative process and attempting to force a decision in their favour. Irezumi reserves the right to suspend or permanently ban Users who attempt to interfere with standard operating procedures for orders which are still active or pending.
46. 8.2 84. Obligation to Reimburse. If a Seller is required to reimburse the Buyer or Irezumi, the Seller authorizes PlayerAuctions to remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other currency) from their designated payment method (i.e. PayPal, Skrill, etc.) on Irezumi. The Seller is required to have a valid payment method on file. If there are insufficient funds in the account, the Seller authorizes Irezumi to charge any reimbursement amount owed to the payment method on file. Irezumi may also place the reimbursement amount on the Seller’s invoice. If Seller does not provide Irezumi with a valid payment method, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.
47. 8.3 86. Fines. In the rare event that Irezumi determines that a dispute between Users is due to a User’s breach of this User Agreement, the breaching User authorizes Irezumi to levy a fine against the User’s payment method, up to £150.00. In addition, Irezumi may suspend or ban the User’s Account, and/or require a deposit of up to £300.00 to reactive the User’s Account.
48. 8.4 88. Release. If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release and indemnify Irezumi and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and subsidiaries from all claims, demands, actions, proceedings, costs, expenses and damages, including without limitation any actual, special, incidental or consequential damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute. In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims that you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.
